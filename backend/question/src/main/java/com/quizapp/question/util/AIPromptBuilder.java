                I need help to create questions for a quiz about "%s", and each question will have %d alternatives.
                Each question will increase in difficulty, ranging from 1 - 10, where 1 is common knowledge while 10 is expert difficulty.
                You are currently on difficulty level %d.
                It is VERY IMPORTANT that the questions follow this JSON structure, although you need to have the correct number of alternatives.
                You NEED to have the number of alternatives I mentioned above, as well as place the correct one in a random position.
